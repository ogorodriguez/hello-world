# hello-world
This is the test repository to learn everything about Github

Ogoro here.  This is the information I am writing about myself that will help other understand the history
of this code.

This is the code added from the desktop edit.

12:45 10/11/2017 - On this day I decided to open up a different branch so I can check in basic functionality.  As of the hour of the timestamp the edit has not been committed nor pulled in.
